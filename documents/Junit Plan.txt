Junit Plan

1. Firstly the identification of  the class or group of classes to be tested in JUNit Plan Tests is done.
2. Identify the class's or classes' anticipated behavior. This required talking with stakeholders and developers while also analysing the documentation, requirements, and specifications.
3.Each test case should cover a particular scenario or use case and contain inputs, anticipated outcomes, and any setup or teardown that may be required.
4.Check the results after running the tests. If the bug is discovered, cover the entire code with alternative scenarios to ensure acceptance.

Example 

AdminTest class

void student() throws a SQLException {
Student student=new Student(); assertEquals(0,student.student("Abhay","2020csb1123","8894576580"));
 assertEquals(1,student.student("aakash","2020csb1060","8894577980"));
}

It accepts a result of 0 for the first input and 1 for the second result, and it covers the entire code with several cases to satisfy the acceptance criteria 

The other test classes I have cover all the classes and methods in my project in a manner similar to this.
